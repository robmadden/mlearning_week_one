It appears that by using the median instead of the mean to build the baseline model we get a higher
RMSE according to my solution in baseline_models.R:

> meanRMSE
[1] 0.1301215
> medianRMSE
[1] 0.1307533


Which means that if these are our only two baseline models we should prefer to use the mean
rather than the median for slightly better predictability.
