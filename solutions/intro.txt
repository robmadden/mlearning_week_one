Hello,

1. What is your background in statistics, machine learning, and AI?

I did not take statistics as part of my undergrad degree (computer science) which is probably what I'm most worried about.
I did take an "AI" class and we studied Bayes, Naive Bayes, neural nets, some other basic artificial intelligence techniques (2007).

2. What do you hope to accomplish by taking this course?

My goal is to become relatively proficient in basic machine learning techniques.
I'm mostly doing this because I'm interested and I want to challenge myself. I am a software engineer by professional but
I doubt that I will actually end up using anything that I'll learn to be honest (at least in the near future).
